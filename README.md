# Zoo Mapping and Maintenance System

## Introduction
The **Zoo Mapping and Maintenance System** is a Java project designed to manage animals in a zoo. It utilizes the concept of inheritance to avoid code duplication between different types of animals. The base class, `Animals`, defines common attributes for all animals, while the derived classes (`Mammals`, `Birds`, and `Reptiles`) add specific attributes for each type of animal.
